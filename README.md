Rules of the game LILA:
Participants put their symbols on cell 68 (Cosmic Consciousness).
Sitting around the playing field, participants take turns throwing a bone, 
passing it clockwise to a neighbor.
To enter the game, you need to throw six points, then the player goes to cell 
number 1 (Gate of Life) and from there, immediately, to cell number 6 (Misconception).
Until the player rolls six, he remains on the cell of Cosmic Consciousness (68) 
and cannot be born in the game.


Each time a player drops the number six (with the exception of the first six, 
                                         which led the player to his birth in the game),
 he rolls the dice again. If six rolls again, 
 the player rolls the die again. As a result, all numbers are summed up.
 A player takes as many steps as total points.
Exception: if six drops out three times in a row, they are not summed, 
but are reset. The player rolls the dice again and takes as many steps 
as there were points in the fourth throw. 


If a player rolls four or more 
sixes in a row, he continues to roll the dice until a number other than 
six falls out, and then he goes forward by the number of steps equal to the total
 sum of all points thrown, and then passes the dice.
 
Arrows and Snakes, symbolizing Virtues and Vices on the path, accelerate the
 playerâ€™s movement and strengthen his internal awareness.
An arrow moves the player up. When a player hits the base of the Arrow, he 
rises up through the body of the Arrow to the cell where its tip is located.
The snake lowers the player down. If the head of the Snake is located in the 
cage where the player got, he falls down her body down to the cage where her 
tail is located.


The game ends when the player enters cell 68 (Cosmic Consciousness) - 
either along the Arrow from the cell of Spiritual Devotion, or during a 
gradual ascent, for example, from cell 66, throwing a deuce.

If the player reaches the eighth row, but, without falling on
 the cell of Cosmic Consciousness (68), goes further and stops
 at the cells with numbers 69, 70 or 71, he must wait until 
 either the exact number of steps that separates him from the cell 
 72 falls out ( Darkness), or a small number that allows him to advance
 two or one step forward (for 69, 1, 2 or 3 are suitable, for 70 - 1 or 2,
                          for 71 - only one). 
 In this case, the player needs to go down to cell 51 (Earth) using the 
 Snake on cell 72 (Darkness).
 
 
If a player enters the Absolute cage (69), he must wait until 
the serpent of Darkness (72) returns him to the ground (51) 
so that he can continue his path to Cosmic Consciousness (68) 
either by gradually moving upward, or, having thrown the three, 
through the field of Spiritual Devotion, from where the arrow 
leads the player directly to his goal. On cell 71, all numbers
 except one are useless for him - just like on cell 67 he can no
 longer use the six that has fallen out. If a unit falls, then he
 enters field 68 and the game ends, but it will continue if two, 
 three, four, five, or six fall.
